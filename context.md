Creating Context in Next.js Applications
========================================

In Next.js applications, data sharing is commonly done using props. However, there is another method called context that allows for centralizing the state of the data and sharing it across all pages and components. In this blog, we will explore how to create a simple context in a Next.js application.

Step 1: Creating the Context
----------------------------

To begin, navigate to the source folder of your application and create a new folder called "context". Inside this folder, create a new file named "index.tsx" (assuming you are using TypeScript). This file will serve as the location for storing our context and its wrapper.

    import React, { createContext } from 'react';
    
    const appContext = createContext();
    
    export const appWrapper = { children } => {
      return <appContext.Provider value={state: 'hello'}>{children}</appContext.Provider>;
    };
    
    export const useAppContext = () => {
      return useContext(appContext);
    };
    

In this code snippet, we import the necessary modules from React and create a context using the createContext function. We then export a function named "appWrapper" that serves as the wrapper for our entire application. It takes in the "children" prop and wraps them within the appContext.Provider component, passing the initial state of "hello" as the value.

Additionally, we export a function named "useAppContext" which can be used to access the context and its state within our components. This function utilizes the useContext hook and returns the appContext.

Step 2: Wrapping the Application
--------------------------------

To use the context we created, we need to wrap our entire application with the appWrapper function. Import the appWrapper from the "context" folder and replace the default div element with it, passing the children as its prop.

    import React from 'react';
    import { appWrapper } from './context';
    
    const App = () => {
      return (
        <appWrapper>
          <!-- Existing code for your application -->
          <div>Your components here</div>
        </appWrapper>
      )
    };
    
    export default App;
    

By wrapping our application with the appWrapper, the context and its state will be accessible to all child components and pages.

Step 3: Using the Context
-------------------------

Now that our application is wrapped with the context, we can use the useAppContext function to access the context state and manipulate it within our components.

    import React from 'react';
    import { useAppContext } from './context';
    
    const HomePage = () => {
      const { state } = useAppContext();
    
      return (
        <div>
          <span>State: {state}</span>
          <button>Change State</button>
        </div>
      )
    };
    
    export default HomePage;
    

In this example, we import the useAppContext function from the "context" folder and use it to access the state of the context. We then render the state value within a span element and provide a button to change the state.

By following these three steps, we can easily create and utilize a context in a Next.js application. Contexts are valuable for sharing data across multiple components and pages, providing a centralized location for managing the state of the application.
