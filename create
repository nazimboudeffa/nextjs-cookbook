Creating Front-End Applications with Next.js
============================================

Introduction to Next.js
-----------------------

Next.js is a JavaScript framework developed by Vercel that allows you to create front-end applications on top of React. In this video, the speaker provides a comprehensive guide on how to create a front-end application using Next.js version 13. They also share valuable tips and advice to keep up with the latest updates and best practices in Next.js development.

Getting Started with Next.js
----------------------------

To get started with Next.js, you can visit the official website at nextjs.org. The website provides documentation and resources for Next.js development. The speaker highlights that Next.js version 13 introduces a new way of building front-end applications.

### Choosing a Router

Next.js version 13 offers two router options: the \`hap router\` and the \`page router\`. The \`hap router\` is the default router introduced in version 13, while the \`page router\` was used in earlier versions. Throughout the course, the speaker focuses on Next.js version 13 and the \`hap router\`.

### Installation

To install Next.js, you can use the \`create-next-app\` command provided in the documentation. The speaker demonstrates the installation process using the command \`npx create-next-app \[project-name\]\`. They opt to use TypeScript and ESLint for code correction and choose to integrate Tailwind CSS for styling. Additionally, they select the option to use a source directory and decide to use the default import Alias. The installation process installs Next.js, React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and ESLint.

Project Structure
-----------------

After the installation, the speaker explores the project structure of a Next.js application. The project includes the \`node\_modules\` folder, the \`public\` folder containing SVG logos, the \`src\` folder containing the application code, configuration files such as \`.eslintrc.json\` and \`next.config.js\`, the \`package.json\` file with dependencies, the \`tailwind.config.js\` file for Tailwind CSS configuration, and the \`tsconfig.json\` file for TypeScript configuration.

Building and Running the Application
------------------------------------

To run the Next.js application locally, the speaker demonstrates the command \`npm run dev\`. This command starts the server and displays the application on \`localhost:3000\`. They explain that the \`dot next\` folder is created during the build process and contains the optimized production build of the application. The speaker also shows how to stop the server and delete the \`dot next\` folder.

### Production Build

The speaker further explains the production build process by running the command \`npm run build\`. This command creates the production build of the application, which can be deployed to a server. They explore the contents of the \`dot next\` folder, including the cache folder, server files, and static files. They highlight the importance of understanding the build process for debugging and troubleshooting in production.
